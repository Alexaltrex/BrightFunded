              We prioritize the copying of trades from successful traders while
              being highly selective in our choices. We understand that not all
              traders, even those funded by our firm, are equally successful. To
              ensure sustainable profitability, we employ a sophisticated rule
              engine that constantly analyzes the risk, reward, and executed
              trades on our funded tradersâ€™ accounts. This allows us to adjust
              our strategies, optimize risk management, and maintain a
              profitable trading ecosystem.
