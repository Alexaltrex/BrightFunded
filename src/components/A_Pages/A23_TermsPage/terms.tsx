        <p>3.1 Ordering and Registration</p>
        <p>
          Services can be ordered through our website by completing the
          appropriate registration or order form. Upon successful registration,
          you will receive your login details for the Client Section and/or
          Trading Platform via email. It is essential that the data provided by
          you during registration or through the Client Section are complete,
          accurate, and current. Inaccurate, incomplete, or outdated information
          may result in your inability to use the Services and our inability to
          contact you.
        </p>
        <p>3.2 Service Offering</p>
        <p>
          Our Services include the BrightFunded Challenge and Verification
          products, which may vary in their scope.
        </p>
        <p>3.3 Fees and Payments</p>
        <p>
          The fee for the BrightFunded Challenge is based on various factors
          including the initial capital amount, degree of risk, and specific
          parameters required to meet the conditions of the BrightFunded
          Challenge and Verification. The fee paid grants you access to the
          BrightFunded Challenge and the Services offered under it. Please note
          that no refunds are given if you decide to cancel your Client Section,
          terminate the use of Services prematurely, fail to meet conditions, or
          violate these Terms & Conditions.
        </p>
        <p>3.4 Unjustifiable Complaints</p>
        <p>
          If you file an unjustifiable complaint or dispute the fee,
          BrightFunded reserves the right to suspend the provision of any
          services and refuse future service provision.
        </p>
        <p>3.5 Change of Service Parameters</p>
        <p>
          The option selected for the BrightFunded Challenge will also apply to
          the subsequent Verification. Once a selection is made, it cannot be
          changed unless a new BrightFunded Challenge is ordered. BrightFunded
          may unilaterally change fees and parameters of Services at any time,
          without affecting Services purchased before notification of the
          change.
        </p>
        <p>3.6 Technical Requirements</p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for procuring the necessary technical equipment
          and software to use the Services, including any third-party software,
          at your own risk and expense.
        </p>
        <p>3.7 Trading Platforms</p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that the operators of trading platforms are distinct
          from BrightFunded, and their terms and conditions, as well as their
          privacy policies, will apply to your use of their platforms.
        </p>
        <p>3.8 Ordering Practices</p>
        <p>
          If you place an unusually large number of orders in a short period,
          BrightFunded may issue a warning or suspend your ability to order
          Services. If such behaviour is related to Forbidden Trading Practices,
          BrightFunded reserves the right to take appropriate action as per
          Section 5 of these Terms & Conditions. Remember, all data entered in
          the order form can be checked, corrected, and amended until the
          Services are ordered. An order is deemed complete when the order form
          is submitted and confirmed via email. Please review all information
          carefully before submitting your order.
        </p>
        <p>3.9 Customers as Traders</p>
        <p>
          Customers providing an identification number, tax registration number,
          or stating they are a legal entity will be considered as traders, and
          rights granted to consumers under Dutch consumer law will not apply to
          them.

        <p>
          4.1 Every Customer is allowed to maintain only one Client Section,
          which is expected to encompass all their services, including
          BrightFunded Challenges and Verifications. It is the responsibility of
          the Customer to ensure that all Services are maintained within this
          single Client Section.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.2 The Provider reserves the right to impose limits on the total
          number of BrightFunded Challenges and Verifications that can be
          associated with a single Client Section. Restrictions may also be
          placed on transferring or combining capital and performance data
          between different products or Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.3 The Customer is responsible for maintaining the confidentiality
          and security of their login data, including username and password. Any
          activities that occur under the Customer's Client Section or Trading
          Platform, including any transactions or modifications, are considered
          to be performed by the Customer and are their sole responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.4 The Customer must promptly notify the Provider in the event of any
          unauthorized access or use of their Client Section or Trading Platform
          or any other breach of security.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.5 The Provider disclaims all liability for instances of service
          unavailability, data loss or other technical issues that may arise
          during the use of the Services. While the Provider will make
          reasonable efforts to ensure the smooth operation of the Services,
          circumstances may arise where the Services are temporarily
          unavailable. The Customer acknowledges this risk and agrees that they
          will not be entitled to claim compensation for such instances.
        </p>
        <p>
          4.6 The Customer has the right to cancel their Client Section at any
          time by sending an email to the Provider. Cancellation of the Client
          Section results in termination of the contract and cessation of access
          to the Services. The Customer acknowledges that upon cancellation,
          they are not entitled to a refund for any fees paid for the Services,
          even if the Services have not been fully used.

    label: 'Demo Trading Conditions and Limitations',
    text: (
      <>
        <p>
          5.1 In Demo Trading, users are authorized to perform all transactions
          unless they contravene Forbidden Trading Practices as outlined in
          Clause 5.4. It is a user's responsibility to adhere to conventional
          market rules and conditions set forth by the Trading Platform,
          inclusive of those related to risk management.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.2 By participating in demo trading, users explicitly consent to the
          Provider accessing their demo trade information. The Provider may also
          share such data with its affiliates. This process may occur
          automatically and does not require further approval from users. No
          compensation shall be provided for the use of such data. Users reserve
          the right to discontinue demo trading at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.3 The Provider makes no guarantees concerning the accuracy or
          availability of information displayed on the Trading Platform. Users
          rely on such information at their own risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.4 The following trading practices are strictly forbidden in demo
          trading:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. Exploiting service errors, whether intentional or not, such as
          delays in price display or updates.
        </p>
        <p>b. Engaging in trades using an external or slow data feed.</p>
        <p>
          c. Acting alone or in collaboration with others to execute trades
          aimed at manipulating trading circumstances, such as placing opposite
          positions simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. Trading in a manner contradictory to the terms and conditions set
          by the Provider and the Trading Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          e. Utilizing software, artificial intelligence, ultra-high-speed
          trading, or mass data entry that could manipulate or abuse the system,
          or confer an unfair advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          f. Gap trading under specified conditions: when significant global
          news, macroeconomic events, or corporate reports that may impact a
          relevant financial market are due, or less than 2 hours before a
          relevant market closes for at least 2 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          g. Trading in a manner that contravenes standard practices in Forex or
          any other financial market, or that could potentially harm the
          Provider, either financially or otherwise (such as overleveraging,
          overexposure, one-sided bets, account rolling).
        </p>
        <p>
          5.5 BrightFunded services are intended solely for personal use. Users
          must not permit third-party access to their BrightFunded Challenge and
          Verification accounts or execute trades on behalf of third parties.
          Any breach of these provisions will be considered a Forbidden Trading
          Practice as per Section 5.4, with corresponding consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.6 Users are advised against exploiting the services by trading
          without employing standard risk management rules. This includes
          initiating significantly larger or smaller position sizes or numbers
          compared to other trades on the same or different customer account.
          The Provider retains the right to decide what constitutes Forbidden
          Trading Practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.7 Should a user engage in Forbidden Trading Practices, the Provider
          may view this as a failure to meet the conditions of the BrightFunded
          Challenge or Verification. The Provider may choose to remove the
          violating transactions from the user's trading history, cancel all
          services, terminate the Agreement, or reduce the offered leverage on
          products to 1:5 on any or all of the user's accounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.8 In cases where Forbidden Trading Practices are performed on one or
          more BrightFunded Challenge and Verification accounts, or accounts of
          various users, or through a combination of BrightFunded Challenge and
          Verification accounts and BrightFunded Trader accounts, the Provider
          reserves the right to cancel all services, terminate all relevant
          contracts, or invoke other measures outlined in Clause 5.5. The
          Provider may exercise any actions in Clauses 5.5 and 5.6 at its sole
          discretion.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.9 If any BrightFunded Trader accounts are implicated in Forbidden
          Trading Practices, this can lead to a breach of the respective terms
          and conditions with third-party providers, culminating in the
          cancellation of all such user accounts and termination of the
          respective agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.10 Repeat engagement in the practices specified in Clause 5.4, after
          prior notice from the Provider, can result in the Provider restricting
          the user's access to all or part of the Services, including the Client
          Section and Trading Platform, without any compensation or refund of
          the fees paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.11 The Provider is not responsible for trading or other investment
          activities performed by the user outside of their relationship with
          the Provider, even if the user employs the same Trading Platform for
          real trading as they use for demo trading.
        </p>
        <p>
          5.12 Users must understand that developments in financial markets are
          often unpredictable and can result in substantial financial losses.
          Past performances and profits from demo trading do not guarantee
          future performance. Trading involves risk and is not suitable for all
          investors.

          6.1 Upon completion of the payment for the BrightFunded Challenge, the
          Provider will furnish customers with login details either through
          email or directly in their Client Section. The activation of the
          BrightFunded Challenge is accomplished by the execution of the first
          demo trade.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.2 Customers should be aware that by commencing the BrightFunded
          Challenge, they effectively renounce their right to withdraw from the
          contract before the services are completed, as outlined in clause 12
          of these Terms and Conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.3 In cases where the BrightFunded Challenge is not activated within
          30 days from the date of payment, access to the challenge will be
          automatically suspended. Customers will have a grace period of six
          months from the date of suspension to request a renewal of access.
          Failure to make such a request within the allotted time will result in
          the termination of the services without entitlement to a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.4 The BrightFunded Challenge will last for 30 calendar days from the

        <p>
          a. Customers are required to open at least one demo trade on four
          different calendar days throughout the duration of the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. Customers must ensure that the reported loss on demo trades opened
          and closed on any calendar day does not exceed 5% of the initial
          capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The total reported loss on demo trades that were opened and closed
          during the course of the BrightFunded Challenge should not exceed 10%

        <p>
          d. The total profit accrued from closed demo trades should amount to
          at least 10% of the initial capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.6 Should the conditions of the BrightFunded Challenge be met and no
          violations of the T occur, especially those related to demo trading
          rules, the Provider will deem the BrightFunded Challenge as
          successful. Subsequently, the Provider will grant the customer free
          access to Verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.7 Customers are permitted to request an evaluation of their
          BrightFunded Challenge performance at any time. Such requests can be
          made via email or through the Client Section. However, it is at the
          Provider's discretion to withhold evaluation if all trades are not
          closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.8 The Verification process is activated by customers initiating a
          demo trade on the Trading Platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.9 If the Verification is not activated within 30 days from receiving
          the login data, access to the Verification will be automatically
          suspended.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.10 Customers may request a renewal of access within six months of
          such suspension either through the Client Section or via email.
          Failure to request a renewal within this grace period will result in
          the termination of the services without any entitlement to a refund.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.11 The Verification will last for a period of 60 calendar days from
          the date of its activation.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.12 By the end of the Verification period, the customer must meet the
          following conditions:
        </p>
        <p>
          a. The customer must open at least one demo trade on at least four
          different calendar days throughout the Verification.
        </p>
        <p>
          b. The customer must not report a loss exceeding 5% of the initial
          capital on any given day.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The customer must not report a total loss exceeding 10% of the
          initial capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          d. The customer must report a cumulative profit from all closed demo
          trades amounting to at least 5% of the initial capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.13 In addition to the conditions stated in clause 6.12, the customer
          must also meet the following requirements to pass the Verification:
        </p>
        <p>a. Compliance with all conditions mentioned in clause 6.5.</p>
        <p>
          b. There should be no violation of the Terms, especially the rules of
          demo trading under clause 5.4.
        </p>
        <p>
          c. The total capital allocation should not exceed USD 400,000 (USD
          200,000 for the Aggressive option) per customer or trading strategy,
          in accordance with the BrightFunded Funded Trader Program agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.14 If the conditions outlined in clauses 6.12 and 6.13 are met, the
          Provider will deem the Verification as successful and will
          subsequently recommend the Customer for the BrightFunded Funded Trader
          program.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.15 Customers can request an evaluation of the Verification at any
          time, provided all transactions are closed. Such requests can be made
          via email or through the Client Section.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.16 Non-compliance with the conditions stated during the BrightFunded
          Challenge or Verification will result in an unsuccessful evaluation
          and consequently denial of access to subsequent steps or
          recommendation for the BrightFunded Funded Trader program. No refund
          of fees paid will be provided in such cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          6.17 While the Provider's recommendation carries weight, it does not
          guarantee acceptance into the BrightFunded Funded Trader Program. The
          Provider bears no responsibility for any rejection from the

          manner that, in the Provider's judgment, could potentially harm the
          Provider, specific remedial actions may be taken. Violations may

          forfeited, and no refunds will be issued. The Provider also reserves
          the right to pursue any other remedies available under law in the
